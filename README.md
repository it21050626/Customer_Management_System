# Customer_Management_System

The Customer Management System is a full-stack application built with Spring Boot (Java 8) for the backend, React.js for the frontend, MariaDB as the database, and Axios for API communication.

It allows users to manage customer records with the following features:

* Create, update, and view customers with attributes such as name, date of birth, NIC, mobile numbers, addresses, and family members.
* Bulk customer upload and update using Excel files, optimized to handle large files with up to 1,000,000 records.
* Master data management for cities and countries to reduce database calls and improve performance.
* Table view to display and search customer records efficiently.
* Includes JUnit tests for backend logic to ensure reliability.

This system provides a scalable and efficient way for organizations to maintain and manage customer data.
